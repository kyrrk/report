abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are “deterministic” by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness (“stochasticity”) is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements.}

abstract  ="Several significant improvements are proposed to the computational molecular spectroscopy protocol MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational–Vibrational Energy Levels) facilitating the inversion of a large set of measured rovibrational transitions to energy levels. The most important algorithmic changes include the use of groups of transitions{,} blocked by their estimated experimental (source segment) uncertainties{,} an inversion and weighted least-squares refinement procedure based on sequential addition of blocks of decreasing accuracy{,} the introduction of spectroscopic cycles into the refinement process{,} automated recalibration{,} synchronization of the combination difference relations to reduce residual uncertainties in the resulting dataset of empirical (MARVEL) energy levels{,} and improved classification of the lines and energy levels based on their accuracy and dependability. The resulting protocol{,} through handling a large number of measurements of similar accuracy{,} retains{,} or even improves upon{,} the best reported uncertainties of the spectroscopic transitions employed. To show its advantages{,} the extended MARVEL protocol is applied for the analysis of the complete set of highly accurate H216O transition measurements. As a result{,} almost 300 highly accurate energy levels of H216O are reported in the energy range of 0–6000 cm−1. Out of the 15 vibrational bands involved in accurately measured rovibrational transitions{,} the following three have definitely highly accurate empirical rovibrational energies of 8–10 digits of accuracy: (v1v2v3) = (0 0 0){,} (0 1 0){,} and (0 2 0){,} where v1{,} v2{,} and v3 stand for the symmetric stretch{,} bend{,} and antisymmetric stretch vibrational quantum numbers. The dataset of experimental rovibrational transitions and empirical rovibrational energy levels assembled during this study{,} both with improved uncertainties{,} is considerably larger and more accurate than the best previous datasets."}

abstract = {The site for the future European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) is already known to be Armazones, near Paranal (Chile). The selection was based on a variety of considerations, with an important one being the quality of the atmosphere for the astronomy planned for the ELT. We present an overview of the characterization of the atmospheric parameters of candidate sites, making use of standard procedures and instruments as carried out within the Framework Programme VI (FP6) of the European Union. We have achieved full characterization of the selected sites for the parameters considered. Further details on adaptive optics results and climatology will be the subject of two forthcoming articles. A summary of the results of the FP6 site-testing campaigns at the different sites is provided.}
