    abstract = "{A more fine-tuned method for probing planet-forming regions, such as protoplanetary discs, could be rovibrational molecular spectroscopy observation of particular premineral molecules instead of more common but ultimately less related volatile organic compounds. Planets are created when grains aggregate, but how molecules form grains is an ongoing topic of discussion in astrophysics and planetary science. Using the spectroscopic data of molecules specifically involved in mineral formation could help to map regions where planet formation is believed to be occurring in order to examine the interplay between gas and dust. Four atoms are frequently associated with planetary formation: Fe, Si, Mg and O. Magnesium, in particular, has been shown to be in higher relative abundance in planet-hosting stars. Magnesium oxide crystals comprise the mineral periclase making it the chemically simplest magnesium-bearing mineral and a natural choice for analysis. The monomer, dimer and trimer forms of (MgO)n with n = 1–3 are analysed in this work using high-level quantum chemical computations known to produce accurate results. Strong vibrational transitions at 12.5, 15.0 and 16.5 μm are indicative of magnesium oxide monomer, dimer and trimer making these wavelengths of particular interest for the observation of protoplanetary discs and even potentially planet-forming regions around stars. If such transitions are observed in emission from the accretion discs or absorptions from stellar spectra, the beginning stages of mineral and, subsequently, rocky body formation could be indicated.}",

    abstract = "{The abundance of magnesium in the interstellar medium is a powerful probe of star formation processes over cosmological time-scales. Magnesium has three stable isotopes, 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg, which can be produced in both massive and intermediate-mass (IM) stars with masses between 2 and 8 M⊙. In this work, we use constraints on the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and explore the role and mass range of IM stars using the observed isotopic ratios. We compare several models of stellar nucleosynthesis with metallicity-dependent yields and also consider the effect of rotation on the yields of massive stars and its consequences on the evolution of the Mg isotopes. We use a cosmic evolution model updated with new observational SFRD data and new reionization constraints coming from 2018 Planck Collaboration determinations. We find that the main contribution of 24Mg comes from massive stars whereas 25Mg and 26Mg come from IM stars. To fit the observational data on magnesium isotopic ratios, an additional IM SFRD component is preferred. Moreover, the agreement between model and data is further improved when the range of IM masses is narrowed towards higher masses (5–8 M⊙). While some rotation also improves the fit to data, we can exclude the case where all stars have high rotational velocities due to an overproduction of 26Mg.}",

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are “deterministic” by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness (“stochasticity”) is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements.}

abstract  ="Several significant improvements are proposed to the computational molecular spectroscopy protocol MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational–Vibrational Energy Levels) facilitating the inversion of a large set of measured rovibrational transitions to energy levels. The most important algorithmic changes include the use of groups of transitions{,} blocked by their estimated experimental (source segment) uncertainties{,} an inversion and weighted least-squares refinement procedure based on sequential addition of blocks of decreasing accuracy{,} the introduction of spectroscopic cycles into the refinement process{,} automated recalibration{,} synchronization of the combination difference relations to reduce residual uncertainties in the resulting dataset of empirical (MARVEL) energy levels{,} and improved classification of the lines and energy levels based on their accuracy and dependability. The resulting protocol{,} through handling a large number of measurements of similar accuracy{,} retains{,} or even improves upon{,} the best reported uncertainties of the spectroscopic transitions employed. To show its advantages{,} the extended MARVEL protocol is applied for the analysis of the complete set of highly accurate H216O transition measurements. As a result{,} almost 300 highly accurate energy levels of H216O are reported in the energy range of 0–6000 cm−1. Out of the 15 vibrational bands involved in accurately measured rovibrational transitions{,} the following three have definitely highly accurate empirical rovibrational energies of 8–10 digits of accuracy: (v1v2v3) = (0 0 0){,} (0 1 0){,} and (0 2 0){,} where v1{,} v2{,} and v3 stand for the symmetric stretch{,} bend{,} and antisymmetric stretch vibrational quantum numbers. The dataset of experimental rovibrational transitions and empirical rovibrational energy levels assembled during this study{,} both with improved uncertainties{,} is considerably larger and more accurate than the best previous datasets."}

The selection was based on a variety of considerations, with an important one being the quality of the atmosphere for the astronomy planned for the ELT. We present an overview of the characterization of the atmospheric parameters of candidate sites, making use of standard procedures and instruments as carried out within the Framework Programme VI (FP6) of the European Union. We have achieved full characterization of the selected sites for the parameters considered. Further details on adaptive optics results and climatology will be the subject of two forthcoming articles. A summary of the results of the FP6 site-testing campaigns at the different sites is provided.}
