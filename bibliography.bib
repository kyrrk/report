abstract = {The tropospheric methane molar fraction (ƒCH4.t) and the ortho/para hydrogen ratio are derived for Uranus and Neptune based on new determinations of spectroscopic parameters for key hydrogen features as reported by D. W. Ferguson et al. (1993, J. Mol. Spec. 160, 315-325). For each planet, the relatively weak laboratory linestrengths (approximately 30 and 15% less than the theoretical 4-0 S(0) and S(1) linestrengths, respectively) results, when compared to analyses adopting theoretical values, in a ∼30% decrease in the tropospheric methane ratio and a comparable increase in the pressure level of the optically thick cloudtop marking the bottom of the visible atmosphere (Pcld). The increase in the ratio of S(1)/S(0) linestrengths from 4.4 (theoretical) to ∼5.9 (measured) results in a decrease in the range of viable ortho/para ratios; an equilibrium hydrogen distribution is now the best fit for both planets. For Uranus, we find ƒCH4.t = 0.016+0.007-0.005, Pcld = 3.1+1.1-0.2 bars, and 0.85 < ƒeH2 ≤ 1.00 (where ƒeH2 and 1 - ƒeH2 denote the fraction of H2 in the equilibrium and normal state, respectively) compared to the K. H. Baines and J. T. Bergstralh (1986, Icarus 56, 543-559) values of ƒCH4.t = 0.030+0.016-0.010, Pcld = 2.7+0.5-0.4 bars, and 0.63 < ƒeH2 < 0.95. For Neptune, we find ƒCH4.t = 0.022+0.005-0.006, Pcld = 3.8+0.7-0.3 bars, and 0.89 < ƒeH2 ≤ 1.0 compared to the K. H. Baines and W. H. Smith (1990, Icarus 85, 65-108) values of ƒCH4.t = 0.03 ± 0.007, Pcld = 3.3+0.5-0.1 bars, and 0.85 < ƒeH2 ≤ 1.0. The methane mixing ratios reported here are in agreement with the value of 0.023 derived by the Voyager Radio Occulatation Experiment (G. F. Lindal 1992, Astron. J. 103, 967-982) for Neptune, but slightly lower than the Voyager Uranus measurement of 0.023 reported by G. F. Lindal et al. (1987, J. Geophys. Res. 92, 14987-15001). The relative carbon-to-hydrogen abundances of 20+9-6 and 28+7-8 times the solar value of 4.7 × 10-4 derived by D. L. Lambert (1978, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 192, 249-272) for Uranus and Neptune support planetary formation mechanisms involving the dissolution of carbon-bearing planetesimals in the atmospheres of both planets during their early stages of formation (e.g., J. B. Pollack et al., 1986, Icarus 67, 409-443).}

A significant depletion of methane gas above the haze layer is indicated.

abstract = {High spectral resolution observations from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer [Flasar, F.M., and 44 colleagues, 2004. Space Sci. Rev. 115, 169–297] are analysed to derive new estimates for the mole fractions of CH4, CH3D and 13CH4 of (4.7±0.2)×10−3, (3.0±0.2)×10−7 and (5.1±0.2)×10−5 respectively. The mole fractions show no hemispherical asymmetries or latitudinal variability. The analysis combines data from the far-IR methane rotational lines and the mid-IR features of methane and its isotopologues, using both the correlated-k retrieval algorithm of Irwin et al. [Irwin, P., and 9 colleagues, 2008. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136–1150] and a line-by-line approach to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved quantities. C/H was found to be enhanced by 10.9±0.5 times the solar composition of Grevesse et al. [Grevesse, N., Asplund, M., Sauval, A., 2007. Space Sci. Rev. 130 (1), 105–114], 2.25±0.55 times larger than the enrichment on Jupiter, and supporting the increasing fractional core mass with distance from the Sun predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation. A comparison of the jovian and saturnian C/N, C/S and C/P ratios suggests different reservoirs of the trapped volatiles in a primordial solar nebula whose composition varies with distance from the Sun. This is supported by our derived D/H ratio in methane of (1.6±0.2)×10−5, which appears to be smaller than the jovian value of Lellouch et al. [Lellouch, E., Bézard, B., Fouchet, T., Feuchtgruber, H., Encrenaz, T., de Graauw, T., 2001. Astron. Astrophys. 370, 610–622]. Mid-IR emission features provided an estimate of C12/C13=91.8−7.8+8.4, which is consistent with both the terrestrial ratio and jovian ratio, suggesting that carbon was accreted from a shared reservoir for all of the planets.}

abstract = {‘Global warming’ is a phrase that refers to the effect on the climate of human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and large-scale deforestation, which cause emissions to the atmosphere of large amounts of ‘greenhouse gases’, of which the most important is carbon dioxide. Such gases absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and act as blankets over the surface keeping it warmer than it would otherwise be. Associated with this warming are changes of climate. The basic science of the ‘greenhouse effect’ that leads to the warming is well understood. More detailed understanding relies on numerical models of the climate that integrate the basic dynamical and physical equations describing the complete climate system. Many of the likely characteristics of the resulting changes in climate (such as more frequent heat waves, increases in rainfall, increase in frequency and intensity of many extreme climate events) can be identified. Substantial uncertainties remain in knowledge of some of the feedbacks within the climate system (that affect the overall magnitude of change) and in much of the detail of likely regional change. Because of its negative impacts on human communities (including for instance substantial sea-level rise) and on ecosystems, global warming is the most important environmental problem the world faces. Adaptation to the inevitable impacts and mitigation to reduce their magnitude are both necessary. International action is being taken by the world's scientific and political communities. Because of the need for urgent action, the greatest challenge is to move rapidly to much increased energy efficiency and to non-fossil-fuel energy sources.}

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH4 band at 3.3 μm with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH4 mixing ratio is 10±3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2×105 cm−2s−1, the CH4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH4 by cometary impacts is 2% of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4% of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of “natural gas” on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases.}

 abstract = {AbstractThis paper reviews the distribution of methane (CH₄) in our Solar System, as well as its sources and sinks in the atmospheres of the main Solar System bodies. Methane is widely distributed in the Solar System. In general, the inner planets are methane-poor, being Earth a unique exception, whereas the outer planets have CH₄-rich atmospheres. In general, the atmospheric chemistry of this compound is dominated by the solar radiation although in O₂-rich atmospheres this compound participates in a reaction system that removes atmospheric CH₄. In our planet most of the atmospheric CH₄ is produced by lifeforms, reason why scientists have proposed that the simultaneous detection of methane signal along with oxygen (O₂) or ozone (O₃) signals in the atmospheric spectra of planets may be good evidence of life. Therefore, the study of this gas at planetary level is important for understanding the chemical reactions that control its abundance on the exoplanetary atmospheres and to classify possible inhabited planets.},

Most of these objects are however hot due to their short orbital period. Models suggest that water is the dominant species in their atmospheres. The hot temperatures are expected to turn these atmospheres into a (high pressure) steam bath containing remains of melted rock. The spectroscopy of these hot rocky objects will be very different from that of cooler objects or hot gas giants. Molecules suggested to be important for the spectroscopy of these objects are reviewed together with the current status of the corresponding spectroscopic data.

We investigated the chemical equilibrium composition of such heated systems from 500 to 4000 K and total pressures from 10−6 to 10+2 bars. The major gases are H2O and CO2 over broad temperature and pressure ranges, and Na, K, O2, SiO, and O at high temperatures and low pressures. We discuss the differences in atmospheric composition arising from vaporization of SiO2-rich (i.e., felsic) silicates (like Earth's continental crust) and MgO-, FeO-rich (i.e., mafic) silicates (like the bulk silicate Earth). The computational results will be useful in planning spectroscopic studies of the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets.}

abstract = {We have conducted petrologic modeling of MESSENGER-derived compositions and analog compositions to gain a better understanding of the petrogenesis of the crust of Mercury. Analog compositions included a 1425°C partial melt of the Indarch (EH4) meteorite and a range of Mg-rich terrestrial rocks (magnesian basalt, basaltic komatiite, and peridotitic komatiite). All models were held at the iron-wüstite buffer to simulate the reducing conditions that likely existed during Mercury's formation. We then compared modeled mineral compositions and abundances, liquidus temperatures, and viscosities to better constrain the characteristics of the lavas that erupted on Mercury's surface. Our results show that the surface composition of Mercury is most similar to that of a terrestrial magnesian basalt (with lowered FeO), composed mainly of Mg-rich orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Because the model magmas are Mg-rich, their counterparts on Mercury would have erupted at high temperatures and displayed low viscosities. Producing melts of these compositions would have required high temperatures at the mantle source regions on Mercury. The inferred low-viscosity lavas would have erupted as thin, laterally extensive flows (depending upon their effusion rate) and would be expected to display surficial flow features that might be preserved to the present.},

abstract = {The discovery measurements of Mercury's exospheric magnesium, obtained by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) probe during its second Mercury flyby, are modeled to constrain the source and loss processes for this neutral species. Fits to a Chamberlain exosphere reveal that at least two source temperatures are required to reconcile the distribution of magnesium measured far from and near the planet: a hot ejection process at the equivalent temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees K, and a competing, cooler source at temperatures as low as 400K. For the energetic component, our models indicate that the column abundance that can be attributed to sputtering under constant southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions is at least a factor of five less than the rate dictated by the measurements. Although highly uncertain, this result suggests that another energetic process, such as the rapid dissociation of exospheric MgO, may be the main source of the distant neutral component. If meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts eject mainly molecules, the total amount of magnesium at altitudes exceeding ∼100km is found to be consistent with predictions by impact vaporization models for molecule lifetimes of no more than two minutes. Though a sharp increase in emission observed near the dawn terminator region can be reproduced if a single meteoroid enhanced the impact vapor at equatorial dawn, it is much more likely that observations in this region, which probe heights increasingly near the surface, indicate a reservoir of volatile Mg being acted upon by lower-energy source processes.}

Planets are created when grains aggregate, but how molecules form grains is an ongoing topic of discussion in astrophysics and planetary science. Using the spectroscopic data of molecules specifically involved in mineral formation could help to map regions where planet formation is believed to be occurring in order to examine the interplay between gas and dust. Four atoms are frequently associated with planetary formation: Fe, Si, Mg and O. Magnesium, in particular, has been shown to be in higher relative abundance in planet-hosting stars. Magnesium oxide crystals comprise the mineral periclase making it the chemically simplest magnesium-bearing mineral and a natural choice for analysis. The monomer, dimer and trimer forms of (MgO)n with n = 1–3 are analysed in this work using high-level quantum chemical computations known to produce accurate results. Strong vibrational transitions at 12.5, 15.0 and 16.5 μm are indicative of magnesium oxide monomer, dimer and trimer making these wavelengths of particular interest for the observation of protoplanetary discs and even potentially planet-forming regions around stars. If such transitions are observed in emission from the accretion discs or absorptions from stellar spectra, the beginning stages of mineral and, subsequently, rocky body formation could be indicated.}",

    abstract = "{The abundance of magnesium in the interstellar medium is a powerful probe of star formation processes over cosmological time-scales. Magnesium has three stable isotopes, 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg, which can be produced in both massive and intermediate-mass (IM) stars with masses between 2 and 8 M⊙. In this work, we use constraints on the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and explore the role and mass range of IM stars using the observed isotopic ratios. We compare several models of stellar nucleosynthesis with metallicity-dependent yields and also consider the effect of rotation on the yields of massive stars and its consequences on the evolution of the Mg isotopes. We use a cosmic evolution model updated with new observational SFRD data and new reionization constraints coming from 2018 Planck Collaboration determinations. We find that the main contribution of 24Mg comes from massive stars whereas 25Mg and 26Mg come from IM stars. To fit the observational data on magnesium isotopic ratios, an additional IM SFRD component is preferred. Moreover, the agreement between model and data is further improved when the range of IM masses is narrowed towards higher masses (5–8 M⊙). While some rotation also improves the fit to data, we can exclude the case where all stars have high rotational velocities due to an overproduction of 26Mg.}",

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are “deterministic” by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness (“stochasticity”) is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements.}

abstract  ="Several significant improvements are proposed to the computational molecular spectroscopy protocol MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational–Vibrational Energy Levels) facilitating the inversion of a large set of measured rovibrational transitions to energy levels. The most important algorithmic changes include the use of groups of transitions{,} blocked by their estimated experimental (source segment) uncertainties{,} an inversion and weighted least-squares refinement procedure based on sequential addition of blocks of decreasing accuracy{,} the introduction of spectroscopic cycles into the refinement process{,} automated recalibration{,} synchronization of the combination difference relations to reduce residual uncertainties in the resulting dataset of empirical (MARVEL) energy levels{,} and improved classification of the lines and energy levels based on their accuracy and dependability. The resulting protocol{,} through handling a large number of measurements of similar accuracy{,} retains{,} or even improves upon{,} the best reported uncertainties of the spectroscopic transitions employed. To show its advantages{,} the extended MARVEL protocol is applied for the analysis of the complete set of highly accurate H216O transition measurements. As a result{,} almost 300 highly accurate energy levels of H216O are reported in the energy range of 0–6000 cm−1. Out of the 15 vibrational bands involved in accurately measured rovibrational transitions{,} the following three have definitely highly accurate empirical rovibrational energies of 8–10 digits of accuracy: (v1v2v3) = (0 0 0){,} (0 1 0){,} and (0 2 0){,} where v1{,} v2{,} and v3 stand for the symmetric stretch{,} bend{,} and antisymmetric stretch vibrational quantum numbers. The dataset of experimental rovibrational transitions and empirical rovibrational energy levels assembled during this study{,} both with improved uncertainties{,} is considerably larger and more accurate than the best previous datasets."}
