    abstract = {The spectrum of dicarbon (C2) is important in astrophysics and for spectroscopic studies of plasmas and flames. The C2 spectrum is characterized by many band systems with new ones still being actively identified; astronomical observations involve eight of these bands. Recently, Furtenbacher et al. presented a set of 5699 empirical energy levels for 12C2, distributed among 11 electronic states and 98 vibronic bands, derived from 42 experimental studies and obtained using the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) procedure.Here, we add data from 13 new sources and update data from 5 sources. Many of these data sources characterize high-lying electronic states, including the newly detected 3 3Πg state. Older studies have been included following improvements in the MARVEL procedure that allow their uncertainties to be estimated. These older works in particular determine levels in the C 1Πg state, the upper state of the insufficiently characterized Deslandres–d’Azambuja (C 1Πg–A 1Πu) band.The new compilation considers a total of 31 323 transitions and derives 7047 empirical (marvel) energy levels spanning 20 electronic and 142 vibronic states. These new empirical energy levels are used here to update the 8states C2 ExoMol line list. This updated line list is highly suitable for high-resolution cross-correlation studies in astronomical spectroscopy of, for example, exoplanets, as 99.4 per cent of the transitions with intensities over 10−18 cm molecule−1 at 1000 K have frequencies determined by empirical energy levels.},

    abstract = {Zirconium monoxide (ZrO) absorption lines define rare S-type stars and are currently being sought on exoplanets. Successful detection is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive line list, with existing data not ideal for many applications. Specifically, the Plez et al. line list is near-complete but has insufficient accuracy for high-resolution cross-correlation, while the Sorensen \&amp; Bernath data have high accuracy but only consider a small number of spectral bands. This article presents a novel spectroscopic model, variational line list, and trihybrid line list for the main 90Zr16O isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the 91Zr16O, 92Zr16O, 93Zr16O, 94Zr16O, and 96Zr16O isotopologues. These were constructed using Duo based on icMRCI-SD/CASSCF ab initio electronic data calculated using molpro, experimental energies obtained from a previous MARVEL data compilation, and perturbative energies from Sorensen \&amp; Bernath. The new 90Zr16O ExoMol-style trihybrid line list, ZorrO, comprises 227 118 energies (13 075 experimental) and 47  662 773 transitions up to 30 000 cm −1 (333 nm) between 10 low-lying electronic states (X 1Σ+, a 3Δ, A 1Δ, b 3Π, B 1Π, C 1Σ+, d 3Φ, e 3Π, f 3Δ, and F 1Δ). The inclusion of experimental energy levels in ZorrO means ZrO will be much easier to detect using high-resolution ground-based telescopes in the 12 500–17 500 cm−1 (571–800 nm) spectral region. The inclusion of variational energy levels means that the ZorrO line list has very high completeness and can accurately model molecular absorption cross-sections even at high temperatures. The ZorrO data will hopefully facilitate the first detection of ZrO in the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter exoplanet, or alternatively more conclusively exclude its presence.},

title = {Evidence for Multiple Companions to υ Andromedae*},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The bright F8 V star υ Andromedae was previously reported to have a 4.6 day Doppler velocity periodicity, consistent with having a Jupiter-mass companion orbiting at 0.059 AU. Follow-up observations by both the Lick and Advanced Fiber-Optic Echelle spectrometer (AFOE) planet survey programs confirm this periodicity and reveal additional periodicities at 241 and 1267 days. These periodicities are consistent with Keplerian orbital motion and imply two additional companions orbiting at 0.83 and 2.5 AU, with minimum (M sin i) masses of 2.0 and 4.6 MJUP, respectively. Non-Keplerian explanations for the observed Doppler velocity variations, including radial and nonradial pulsations, rotational modulation of surface features, and stellar magnetic cycles, are examined. These explanations seem unlikely based on the observed photometric and chromospheric stability of the star. This putative three-planet system is found to be dynamically stable by both analytic techniques and numerical simulations. The outer two companions both reside in eccentric orbits, as do all nine known extrasolar planet candidates in distant orbits. If real, this multiple-planet system is the first around a main-sequence star, and its study should offer insights into planet formation, planet-planet interactions, and the observed eccentricities of planetary orbits.}

abstract="This chapter deals with the discovery of the first extrasolar planets around normal stars. This discovery took place in the mid-1990s thanks to the analysis of periodic Doppler shifts in stellar spectra and turned out to be a landmark achievement, in that it established a new field of research that is growing at full speed since then, and at the same time, it answered a question---do other worlds exist in the cosmos? ---that dates back to ancient times. This major result was made possible by the impressive improvement in Doppler analysis techniques during the second half of the twentieth century, until the precision boosted to values suitable to detect massive planets in close-in orbits. In the late 1980s, two objects came to the limelight: HD 114762 b and $\gamma$ Cep b. They were suspected to be exoplanets, but it was not possible to rule out alternative explanations, so no undisputable discovery could be claimed. A few years later, in 1995, the discovery of 51 Peg b was announced and confirmed as the first secure one. However, the features of this planet were quite weird as compared to those of the planets of the Solar System, as it was massive and very close to its parent star. Its discovery overturned the previously widespread idea that other systems had to be made like ours and opened the floodgates to the spotting of many other planets. This chapter tells this story, mainly dwelling upon the historical and epistemological aspects.",

We briefly summarize the most important aspects of planet formation, with an emphasis on processes that may be testable with small exoplanets, in particular those that affect their composition. Complementary, we also describe the observed compositional diversity of low-mass exoplanets and what it teaches us about planet formation pathways. We finish this review summarizing the study of the composition of small exoplanets during the very last stage of stellar evolution, by studying white dwarfs. This review is written as the JWST is making its first contributions to small planet characterization, rapidly opening new lines of inquiry.}

Follow-up photometry reveals a drop of 0.017 mag at the predicted time (within the errors) of transit by the companion based on the velocities. This is the first extrasolar planet observed to transit its star. The radius of the planet derived from the magnitude of the dimming is 1.42 RJup, which is consistent with models of irradiated Jupiter-mass planets. The transit implies that sin i &gt; 0.993, leading to a true mass of 0.62 MJup for the planet. The resulting mean density of 0.27 g cm-3 implies that the companion is a gas giant.}

To date, only \$\\sim 40\$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. TOI-2490b is a \$73.6\\pm 2.4\$  \$M\_\{\\rm J\}\$, \$1.00\\pm 0.02\$  \$R\_\{\\rm J\}\$ brown dwarf orbiting a \$1.004\_\{-0.022\}^\{+0.031\}\$  \$\{\\rm M\}\_\{\\odot \}\$, \$1.105\_\{-0.012\}^\{+0.012\}\$  \$\{\\rm R\}\_\{\\odot \}\$ sun-like star on a 60.33 d orbit with an eccentricity of \$0.77989\\pm 0.00049\$. The discovery was detected within Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite sectors 5 (30 min cadence) and 32 (2 min and 20 s cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity measurements with FEROS by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations with the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star estimates an age of \$\\sim 8\$ Gyr, which is supported by estimations from kinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not consistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an inflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity higher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic studies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of stellar formation mechanisms.},

We detect two separate transit events at times that are consistent with the radial velocity measurements. In both cases, the detailed shape of the transit curve due to both the limb darkening of the star and the finite size of the planet is clearly evident. Assuming stellar parameters of 1.1 R⊙ and 1.1 M⊙, we find that the data are best interpreted as a gas giant with a radius of 1.27 ± 0.02 RJup in an orbit with an inclination of 87.°1 ± 0.°2. We present values for the planetary surface gravity, escape velocity, and average density and discuss the numerous observations that are warranted now that a planet is known to transit the disk of its parent star.}

Quick increase in the zenith column density of Na atoms above the lunar north pole on August 13, 2009 at 0–1 UT is detected and explained by numerous collisions of relatively small Perseid meteoroids (<1kg) with the Moon during maximum of the Perseid meteor shower. New stringent upper limits of the column densities for Ca, Ba, and Ti atoms in the lunar exosphere are obtained as 5×107, 2.2×106, and 6.9×108cm−2, respectively. It is found that the content of impact-produced Ca and Al atoms in the lunar exosphere is depleted as compared to that of Na atoms.}

abstract = {This paper describes the contents of the 2016 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.}

This results in better fit to the spectrum of WZ Cas in which the absorption feature at 3.56 μm is reproduced to a higher degree of accuracy than has previously been possible. We improve the reproduction of HCN absorption features by reducing the abundance of Si to [Si/H]=−0.5 dex, however, the strengths of the Δv= 2 CS band heads are overpredicted.},

abstract = {We obtained spectra in the wavelength range λ = 995–1769 nm of all four known planets orbiting the star HR 8799. Using the suite of instrumentation known as Project 1640 on the Palomar 5 m Hale Telescope, we acquired data at two epochs. This allowed for multiple imaging detections of the companions and multiple extractions of low-resolution (R ∼ 35) spectra. Data reduction employed two different methods of speckle suppression and spectrum extraction, both yielding results that agree. The spectra do not directly correspond to those of any known objects, although similarities with L and T dwarfs are present, as well as some characteristics similar to planets such as Saturn. We tentatively identify the presence of CH4 along with NH3 and/or C2H2, and possibly CO2 or HCN in varying amounts in each component of the system. Other studies suggested red colors for these faint companions, and our data confirm those observations. Cloudy models, based on previous photometric observations, may provide the best explanation for the new data presented here. Notable in our data is that these presumably co-eval objects of similar luminosity have significantly different spectra; the diversity of planets may be greater than previously thought. The techniques and methods employed in this paper represent a new capability to observe and rapidly characterize exoplanetary systems in a routine manner over a broad range of planet masses and separations. These are the first simultaneous spectroscopic observations of multiple planets in a planetary system other than our own.}

The aim of our study is to improve our understanding of the production of nitrogen compounds and to predict the abundances of those with high molar mass with better accuracy. We have made a careful investigation of the neutral nitrogen photochemistry to improve current chemical schemes including the most abundant species and the most efficient reactions. We also studied the propagation of uncertainties on rate constants in our model and determined the key reactions from a global sensitivity analysis. Our photochemical model contains 124 species, 60 of which are nitrogen containing compounds, and 1141 reactions. Our results are in reasonable agreement with Cassini/INMS data in the higher atmosphere but our model overestimates the mole fractions of several nitriles in the lower stratosphere. New species such as CH3C3N and C3H7CN could be relatively abundant in Titan’s atmosphere. Uncertainties on some nitrogen compounds are important and further studies of the key reactions that we have identified are needed to improve the predictivity of photochemical models. Meridional transport is expected to be an efficient process to govern the abundances of several nitriles in the lower stratosphere.}

journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is one of the sulfur-bearing molecules detected in different astronomical environments, including comets. The present-day sulfur chemistry in comets may reveal much about the origin of these ices and their subsequent processing history. Cometary sulfur molecules such as H2S, H2CS, SO2, SO, CS, CS2, S2, and NS have been detected in many comets. However, OCS, the only sulfur-bearing species with fluorescence emission lines at infrared wavelengths, is under-represented in comet volatile studies, having been reported in only six comets so far. We targeted OCS with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in comets 46P/Wirtanen, 21P/Giacobini–Zinner, and C/2015 ER61 (PanSTARRS) in 2017–2018 using the high-resolution iSHELL spectrograph, and in C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) in 2004 using the heritage CSHELL spectrograph. In comet C/2015 ER61, the OCS abundance was similar to those measured in bright comets such as comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake), whereas in C/2002 T7 it was relatively depleted. Our OCS measurement in 21P/Giacobini–Zinner is the first definitive detection of this molecule in a Jupiter-family comet from a ground-based facility and is close to the average OCS abundance determined in comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission. Our 3σ upper limit for comet 46P/Wirtanen is the lowest reported OCS abundance in any comet. We present production rates and mixing ratios (with respect to H2O) for these comets and place our results in the context of comets measured to date.}

abstract = {Abstract We observed Venus with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope TripleSpec spectrograph (R = 3500, λ = 0.96–2.47 µm) on 1–3 March 2009 and on 25, 27, and 30 November and 2–4 December 2010. With these observations and synthetic spectra generated with the Spectral Mapping and Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model, we produce the first simultaneous maps of cloud opacity, acid concentration, water vapor (H2O), hydrogen chloride (HCl), carbon dioxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) abundances in the Venusian lower atmosphere. Water measured at wavelengths near 1.18 µm (near-surface) averages 29 ± 2ppm (2009) and 27 ± 2 ppm (2010) and measured near 1.74 µm (15–30 km) averages 33 ± 2 ppm (2009) and 32 ± 2 ppm (2010). Water in both these altitude ranges is spatially homogeneous. Water measured near 2.4 µm (30–45 km) averages 34 ± 2 ppm (2009) and 33 ± 3 ppm (2010) and is spatially inhomogeneous and variable. HCl is measured near 1.74 µm to be 0.41 ± 0.04 ppm (2009) and 0.42 ± 0.05 ppm (2010). CO and OCS (2.3–2.5 µm; 30–45 km in altitude) are spatially inhomogeneous and show anticorrelation. CO (35 km) averages 25 ± 3 ppm (2009) and 22 ± 2 ppm (2010). OCS (36 km) averages 0.44 ± 0.10 ppm (2009) and 0.57 ± 0.12 ppm (2010). SO2 measurements average 140 ± 37 ppm (2009) and 126 ± 32 ppm (2010). Many species display a hemispherical dichotomy in their distribution. We find considerable spatial variability suggesting active processes with conservation between species. The most variable regions are just below the Venus cloud deck, and these may be related to changes in atmospheric circulation or virga events.},

title = {Silicon and Hydrogen Chemistry under Laboratory Conditions Mimicking the Atmosphere of Evolved Stars},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Silicon is present in interstellar dust grains, meteorites and asteroids, and to date 13 silicon-bearing molecules have been detected in the gas phase toward late-type stars or molecular clouds, including silane and silane derivatives. In this work, we have experimentally studied the interaction between atomic silicon and hydrogen under physical conditions mimicking those in the atmosphere of evolved stars. We have found that the chemistry of Si, H, and H2 efficiently produces silane (SiH4), disilane (Si2H6) and amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) grains. Silane has been definitely detected toward the carbon-rich star IRC +10216, while disilane has not been detected in space yet. Thus, based on our results, we propose that gas-phase reactions of atomic Si with H and H2 are a plausible source of  silane in C-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, although its contribution to the total SiH4 abundance may be low in comparison with the suggested formation route by catalytic reactions on the surface of dust grains. In addition, the produced a-Si:H dust analogs decompose into SiH4 and Si2H6 at temperatures above 500 K, suggesting an additional mechanism of formation of these species in envelopes around evolved stars. We have also found that the exposure of these dust analogs to water vapor leads to the incorporation of oxygen into Si–O–Si and Si–OH groups at the expense of SiH moieties, which implies that if this kind of grain is present in the interstellar medium, it will probably be processed into silicates through the interaction with water ices covering the surface of dust grains.}

abstract = {Infrared spectra of Io in the region 2.5–5.0 μm, including new observational data, are analyzed using detailed laboratory studies of plausible surface ices. Besides the absorption bands attributable to sulfur dioxide frosts, four infrared spectral features of Io are shown to be unidentified. These unidentified features show spatial and temporal band strength variations. One pair is centered around 3.9 μm (3.85 and 3.91 μm) and the second pair is centered around 3.0 μm (2.97 and 3.15 μm). These absorptions fall close to the fundamental stretching modes in H2S and H2O, respectively. The infrared absorption spectra of an extensive set of laboratory ices ranging from pure materials, to binary mixtures of H2S and H2O (either mixed at different concentrations or layered), to H2O:H2S:SO2 mixtures are discussed. The effects of ultraviolet irradiation (120 and 160 nm) and temperature variation (from 9 to 130 K) on the infrared spectra of the ices are examined. This comparative study of Io reflectance spectra with the laboratory mixed ice transmission data shows the following: (1) Io's surface most likely contains H2S and H2O mixed with SO2. The 3.85- and 3.91-μm bands in the Io spectra can be accounted for by the absorption of the SH stretching vibration (ν1) in H2S clusters and isolated molecules in an SO2-dominated ice. The weak 2.97- and 3.15-μm bands which vary spatially and temporally in the Io spectra coincide with the ν3 and ν1 OH stretching vibrations of clusters of H2O molecules complexed, through hydrogen bonding and charge transfer interactions, with SO2. (2) The observations are well matched qualitatively by the transmission spectra of SO2 ices containing about 3% H2S and 0.1% H2O which have been formed by the condensation of a mixture of the gases onto a 100 K surface. (3) No new features are produced in the region 2.5 to 5.0 μm in the spectrum of these ices under prolonged ultraviolet irradiation or temperature variation up to 120 K. (4) Comparison of the Io spectra to transmission spectra of both mixed molecular ices and layered ices indicates that only the former can explain the shifts and splitting of the absorption bands seen in the Io spectrum and additionally can account for the fact that solid H2S is observed in the surface material of Io at temperature and pressure conditions above the sublimation point of pure H2S.}

abstract = {The chemical environments of young planets are assumed to be largely influenced by the impacts of bodies lingering on unstable trajectories after the dissolution of the protoplanetary disk. We explore the chemical consequences of impacts within the context of reducing planetary atmospheres dominated by carbon monoxide, methane, and molecular nitrogen. A terawatt high-power laser was selected in order to simulate the airglow plasma and blast wave surrounding the impactor. The chemical results of these experiments are then applied to a theoretical atmospheric model. The impact simulation results in substantial volume mixing ratios within the reactor of 5% hydrogen cyanide (HCN), 8% acetylene (C2H2), 5% cyanoacetylene (HC3N), and 1% ammonia (NH3). These yields are combined with estimated impact rates for the early Earth to predict surface boundary conditions for an atmospheric model. We show that impacts might have served as sources of energy that would have led to steady-state surface quantities of 0.4% C2H2, 400 ppm HCN, and 40 ppm NH3. We provide simulated transit spectra for an Earth-like exoplanet with this reducing atmosphere during and shortly after eras of intense impacts. We predict that acetylene is as observable as other molecular features on exoplanets with reducing atmospheres that have recently gone through their own “heavy bombardments,” with prominent features at 3.05 and 10.5 μm.}

abstract = {The infrared interferometer spectrometer on Voyager 2 obtained thermal emission spectra of Neptune with a spectral resolution of 4.3 cm-1. Measurements of reflected solar radiation were also obtained with a broadband radiometer sensitive in the visible and near infrared. Analysis of the strong C2H2 emission feature at 729 cm-1 suggests an acetylene mole fraction in the range between 9 × 10-8 and 9 × 10-7. Vertical temperature profiles were derived between 30 and 1000 millibars at 70° and 42°S and 30°N. Temperature maps of the planet between 80°S and 30°N were obtained for two atmospheric layers, one in the lower stratosphere between 30 and 120 millibars and the other in the troposphere between 300 and 1000 millibars. Zonal mean temperatures obtained from these maps and from latitude scans indicate a relatively warm pole and equator with cooler mid-latitudes. This is qualitatively similar to the behavior found on Uranus even though the obliquities and internal heat fluxes of the two planets are markedly different. Comparison of winds derived from images with the vertical wind shear calculated from the temperature field indicates a general decay of wind speed with height, a phenomenon also observed on the other three giant planets. Strong, wavelike longitudinal thermal structure is found, some of which appears to be associated with the Great Dark Spot. An intense, localized cold region is seen in the lower stratosphere, which does not appear to be correlated with any visible feature. A preliminary estimate of the effective temperature of the planet yields a value of 59.3 ± 1.0 kelvins. Measurements of Triton provide an estimate of the daytime surface temperature of 38+3-4 kelvins.}}

abstract = {We present high spectral resolution observations from 12.96 to 13.33 microns toward Orion IRc2 using the mid-infrared spectrograph, Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES), at Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These observations probe the physical and chemical conditions of the Orion hot core, which is sampled by a bright, compact, mid-infrared background continuum source in the region, IRc2. All 10 of the rovibrational C2H2 transitions expected in our spectral coverage are detected with high signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns), yielding continuous coverage of the R-branch lines from J = 9–8 to J = 18–17, including both ortho and para species. Eight of these rovibrational transitions are newly reported detections. The isotopologue, 13CCH2, is clearly detected with a high S/N. This enabled a direct measurement of the 12C/13C isotopic ratio for the Orion hot core of 14 ± 1 and an estimated maximum value of 21. We also detected several HCN rovibrational lines. The ortho and para C2H2 ladders are clearly separate, and tracing two different temperatures, 226 K and 164 K, respectively, with a non-equilibrium ortho to para ratio (OPR) of 1.7 ± 0.1. Additionally, the ortho and para VLSR values differ by about 1.8 ± 0.2 km s−1, while the mean line widths differ by 0.7 ± 0.2 km s−1, suggesting that these species are not uniformly mixed along the line of sight to IRc2. We propose that the abnormally low C2H2 OPR could be a remnant from an earlier, colder phase, before the density enhancement (now the hot core) was impacted by shocks generated from an explosive event 500 years ago.}

All 26 low-resolution spectra show acetylene (C2H2) bands at 7 and 14 μm. The hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. This is consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 μm C2H2  band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There is no clear dilution of the 14 μm C2H2  band by circumstellar dust emission. This 14-μm band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope in these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings for Galactic stars. The C2H2 column density, derived from the 13.7 μm band, shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3 × 10−6 to 5 × 10−5 M⊙ yr−1. This is comparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the spectral energy distribution. Additionally, we compare the line strengths of the 13.7 μm C2H2  band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample. Despite the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the C2H2  abundance among LMC and Galactic stars. This reflects the effect of the third dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high carbon-to-oxygen ratio at low metallicity.}",

abstract = {The Cassini spacecraft passed within 168.2 kilometers of the surface above the southern hemisphere at 19:55:22 universal time coordinated on 14 July 2005 during its closest approach to Enceladus. Before and after this time, a substantial atmospheric plume and coma were observed, detectable in the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) data set out to a distance of over 4000 kilometers from Enceladus. INMS data indicate that the atmospheric plume and coma are dominated by water, with significant amounts of carbon dioxide, an unidentified species with a mass-to-charge ratio of 28 daltons (either carbon monoxide or molecular nitrogen), and methane. Trace quantities (\&lt;1\%) of acetylene and propane also appear to be present. Ammonia is present at a level that does not exceed 0.5\%. The radial and angular distributions of the gas density near the closest approach, as well as other independent evidence, suggest a significant contribution to the plume from a source centered near the south polar cap, as distinct from a separately measured more uniform and possibly global source observed on the outbound leg of the flyby.}}

abstract = {We report observations of acetylene emission lines near 13.3 μm on Jupiter recorded at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in July 1984. A strong enhancement in the intensity of R10 line of the ν5 band was recorded within a well-localized region coincident with the southern extension of footprint of the Io magnetic lines and with previous observations of localized enhanced emission of CH4 lines. The line intensity was fairly constant outside this “bright spot.” Moreover, weak lines of the hot bands 2ν5 - ν5, and (ν4 + ν5) - ν5 were observed within the bright spot. From the field of view and the precision of the pointing, the zone of activity of the bright spot is found to be: latitude = 59 ± 10° and longitude = 178 ± 10° (System III, 1965). The location of the spot was found to be constant over a 3-day period. Two interpretations are proposed to explain these observations: (1) a variation of the C2H2 abundance and (2) an alteration of the thermal profile in the bright spot. Either may result from precipitation of charged particles near and below the Jovian homopause.}

abstract = {Application of noise filtering and inversion techniques to single-channel UVS lightcurves obtained during the Voyager 2 solar occultation at Uranus has yielded tighter constraints on the structure and composition of the upper equatorial stratosphere at the time of the encounter. Specifically, atmospheric pressure and temperature profiles in the altitude region bracketted by total number densities 2 × 1015 cm−3 and 5 × 1016 cm−3 have been derived, based on the observed H2 Rayleigh scattering opacity profiles (wavelengths > 153 nm) with an assumed helium mixing ration of 0.15: at the density level 3.3 (±0.2) × 1016 cm−3, the pressure is 0.60 (±0.01) mbar with a temperature 133 (±8) K. Lightcurves obtained at shorter wavelengths reveal the mixing ratio of accetylene to be increasing (0.7 × 10−8–1.5 × 10−8) with increasing pressure in the pressure interval 0.10−0.30 mbar. Ethane is also present at these pressures with a mixing ratio of roughly 10−8; if methane is present at mixing ratios in excess of roughly 3 × 10−7, then the ethane estimate may need to be halved. Comparison with photochemical models indicates values of 103-10-4 cm2 sec−1 for the eddy mixing coefficient at the methane homopause, depending on the manner in which eddy mixing is assumed to vary with atmospheric number density. It has not been possible to obtain meaningful results from the stellar occultations, which are characterized by poor signal-to-noise ratios.}

abstract = {To investigate the details of hydrocarbon photochemistry on Saturn, we have developed a one-dimensional diurnally averaged model that couples hydrocarbon and oxygen photochemistry, molecular and eddy diffusion, radiative transfer, and condensation. The model results are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) to place tighter constraints on molecular abundances, to better define Saturn's eddy diffusion coefficient profile, and to identify important chemical schemes that control the abundances of the observable hydrocarbons in Saturn's upper atmosphere. From the ISO observations, we determine that the column densities of CH3, CH3C2H, and C4H2 above 10 mbar are 4+2−1.5×1013 cm−2, (1.1±0.3)×1015 cm−2, and (1.2±0.3)×1014 cm−2, respectively. The observed ISO emission features also indicate C2H2 mixing ratios of 1.2+0.9−0.6×10−6 at 0.3 mbar and (2.7±0.8)×10−7 at 1.4 mbar, and a C2H6 mixing ratio of (9±2.5)×10−6 at 0.5 mbar. Upper limits are provided for C2H4, CH2CCH2, C3H8, and C6H2. The sensitivity of the model results to variations in the eddy diffusion coefficient profile, the solar flux, the CH4 photolysis branching ratios, the atomic hydrogen influx, and key reaction rates are discussed in detail. We find that C4H2 and CH3C2H are particularly good tracers of important chemical processes and physical conditions in Saturn's upper atmosphere, and C2H6 is a good tracer of the eddy diffusion coefficient in Saturn's lower stratosphere. The eddy diffusion coefficient must be smaller than ∼3×104 cm2 s−1 at pressures greater than 1 mbar in order to reproduce the C2H6 abundance inferred from ISO observations. The eddy diffusion coefficients in the upper stratosphere could be constrained by observations of CH3 radicals if the low-temperature chemistry of CH3 were better understood. We also discuss the implications of our modeling for aerosol formation in Saturn's lower stratosphere—diacetylene, butane, and water condense between ∼1 and 300 mbar in our model and will dominate stratospheric haze formation at nonauroral latitudes. Our photochemical models will be useful for planning observational sequences and for analyzing data from the upcoming Cassini mission.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on Earth today has biogenic and anthropogenic sources. During the Covid-19 pandemic, observations of global NO2 emissions have shown a significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of NO2 as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO2 as an atmospheric technosigNature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf, and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO2 concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars because there are fewer short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO2. In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO2 on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10 pc can be detected with signal-to-noise ratio ∼5 within ∼400 hr with a 15 m LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2–0.7 μm range where NO2 has a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the NO2 feature. Historically, global NO2 levels were 3× higher, indicating the capability of detecting a civilization at the stage where Earth’s civilization was 40 yr ago. Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral sigNatures of NO2 on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several hundred hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO2 absorption in this region and because of masking features by dominant H2O and CO2 bands in the infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels could be used to place upper limits on the prevalence of NO2 as a technosigNature.}

abstract = {We present the results of the first three-dimensional (3-D) simulation of the water isotope HDO in the Martian atmosphere. This deuterated isotope of water has long been used on both Earth and Mars as a proxy to understand the climatic evolutions of these planets. On Mars, the current enrichment in deuterium concentration in the atmosphere is believed to be indirect evidence of a wetter climate in the past. Due to its vapor pressure being lower than that of H2O, HDO gets fractionated at condensation and therefore concentrates in the Martian water ice clouds. Our study aims at understanding the latitudinal, vertical, and temporal variations of this species under current Martian climate. Our results indicate that the globally averaged D/H ratio in the Martian atmosphere should vary modestly with season, with changes on the order of 2\%. Locally, however, this same ratio exhibits large annual changes (by a factor of 2) in the high-latitude regions. These fluctuations are controlled by the Polar Hood water ice clouds, within which HDO gets heavily fractionated. Due to the combined action of summer clouds above the north polar cap and to the cold-trapping effect of the south residual cap, the global atmospheric deuterium concentration is predicted to be more than 15\% lower than the concentration in the north permanent cap ice. We thus extrapolate by suggesting that the “true” D/H ratio of Martian water may exceed 6.5 (wrt. SMOW), rather than the 5.6 inferred from atmospheric probing. The globally and annually averaged vertical distribution of HDO exhibits a mild decline with altitude, a result in significant contrast with previous 1-D studies. These results will help constrain more accurately the photochemical models aimed at understanding the observed low concentration of deuterium at high altitudes and thus the process of water escape to space.},

abstract = {A non-linear spectroscopic study of the HDO molecule is performed in the wavelength range of 1.36--1.42 $\mu$m using noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical-heterodyne molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS). More than 100 rovibrational Lamb dips are recorded, with an experimental precision of 2--20 kHz, related to the first overtone of the O--H stretch fundamental of HD16O and HD18O. Significant perturbations, including distortions, shifts, and splittings, have been observed for a number of Lamb dips. These spectral perturbations are traced back to an AC-Stark effect, arising due to the strong laser field applied in all saturation-spectroscopy experiments. The AC-Stark effect mixes parity pairs, that is pairs of rovibrational states whose assignment differs solely in the Kc quantum number, where Kc is part of the standard J                           K               a,K               c             asymmetric-top rotational label. Parity-pair mixing seems to be especially large for parity pairs with Ka $\geq$ 3, whereby their energy splittings become as small as a few MHz, resulting in multi-component asymmetric Lamb-dip profiles of gradually increasing complexity. These complex profiles often include crossover resonances. This effect is well known in saturation spectroscopy, but has not been reported in combination with parity-pair mixing. Parity-pair mixing is not seen in H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}2 16O and H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}2 18O, because their parity pairs correspond to ortho and para nuclear-spin isomers, whose interaction is prohibited. Despite the frequency shifts observed for HD16O and HD18O, the absolute accuracy of the detected transitions still exceeds that achievable by Doppler-limited techniques.},

abstract = {High spectral resolution observations from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer [Flasar, F.M., and 44 colleagues, 2004. Space Sci. Rev. 115, 169–297] are analysed to derive new estimates for the mole fractions of CH4, CH3D and 13CH4 of (4.7±0.2)×10−3, (3.0±0.2)×10−7 and (5.1±0.2)×10−5 respectively. The mole fractions show no hemispherical asymmetries or latitudinal variability. The analysis combines data from the far-IR methane rotational lines and the mid-IR features of methane and its isotopologues, using both the correlated-k retrieval algorithm of Irwin et al. [Irwin, P., and 9 colleagues, 2008. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136–1150] and a line-by-line approach to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved quantities. C/H was found to be enhanced by 10.9±0.5 times the solar composition of Grevesse et al. [Grevesse, N., Asplund, M., Sauval, A., 2007. Space Sci. Rev. 130 (1), 105–114], 2.25±0.55 times larger than the enrichment on Jupiter, and supporting the increasing fractional core mass with distance from the Sun predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation. A comparison of the jovian and saturnian C/N, C/S and C/P ratios suggests different reservoirs of the trapped volatiles in a primordial solar nebula whose composition varies with distance from the Sun. This is supported by our derived D/H ratio in methane of (1.6±0.2)×10−5, which appears to be smaller than the jovian value of Lellouch et al. [Lellouch, E., Bézard, B., Fouchet, T., Feuchtgruber, H., Encrenaz, T., de Graauw, T., 2001. Astron. Astrophys. 370, 610–622]. Mid-IR emission features provided an estimate of C12/C13=91.8−7.8+8.4, which is consistent with both the terrestrial ratio and jovian ratio, suggesting that carbon was accreted from a shared reservoir for all of the planets.}

abstract = {‘Global warming’ is a phrase that refers to the effect on the climate of human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and large-scale deforestation, which cause emissions to the atmosphere of large amounts of ‘greenhouse gases’, of which the most important is carbon dioxide. Such gases absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and act as blankets over the surface keeping it warmer than it would otherwise be. Associated with this warming are changes of climate. The basic science of the ‘greenhouse effect’ that leads to the warming is well understood. More detailed understanding relies on numerical models of the climate that integrate the basic dynamical and physical equations describing the complete climate system. Many of the likely characteristics of the resulting changes in climate (such as more frequent heat waves, increases in rainfall, increase in frequency and intensity of many extreme climate events) can be identified. Substantial uncertainties remain in knowledge of some of the feedbacks within the climate system (that affect the overall magnitude of change) and in much of the detail of likely regional change. Because of its negative impacts on human communities (including for instance substantial sea-level rise) and on ecosystems, global warming is the most important environmental problem the world faces. Adaptation to the inevitable impacts and mitigation to reduce their magnitude are both necessary. International action is being taken by the world's scientific and political communities. Because of the need for urgent action, the greatest challenge is to move rapidly to much increased energy efficiency and to non-fossil-fuel energy sources.}

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH4 band at 3.3 μm with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH4 mixing ratio is 10±3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2×105 cm−2s−1, the CH4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH4 by cometary impacts is 2% of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4% of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of “natural gas” on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases.}

 abstract = {AbstractThis paper reviews the distribution of methane (CH₄) in our Solar System, as well as its sources and sinks in the atmospheres of the main Solar System bodies. Methane is widely distributed in the Solar System. In general, the inner planets are methane-poor, being Earth a unique exception, whereas the outer planets have CH₄-rich atmospheres. In general, the atmospheric chemistry of this compound is dominated by the solar radiation although in O₂-rich atmospheres this compound participates in a reaction system that removes atmospheric CH₄. In our planet most of the atmospheric CH₄ is produced by lifeforms, reason why scientists have proposed that the simultaneous detection of methane signal along with oxygen (O₂) or ozone (O₃) signals in the atmospheric spectra of planets may be good evidence of life. Therefore, the study of this gas at planetary level is important for understanding the chemical reactions that control its abundance on the exoplanetary atmospheres and to classify possible inhabited planets.},

The spectroscopy of these hot rocky objects will be very different from that of cooler objects or hot gas giants.

Some of the planets are exposed to extreme temperatures as they orbit close to their host stars, e.g., CoRot-7b, and all of these planets have equilibrium temperatures significantly hotter than the Earth. Such planets can develop atmospheres through (partial) vaporization of their crustal and/or mantle silicates. We investigated the chemical equilibrium composition of such heated systems from 500 to 4000 K and total pressures from 10−6 to 10+2 bars. The major gases are H2O and CO2 over broad temperature and pressure ranges, and Na, K, O2, SiO, and O at high temperatures and low pressures. We discuss the differences in atmospheric composition arising from vaporization of SiO2-rich (i.e., felsic) silicates (like Earth's continental crust) and MgO-, FeO-rich (i.e., mafic) silicates (like the bulk silicate Earth). The computational results will be useful in planning spectroscopic studies of the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets.}

Analog compositions included a 1425°C partial melt of the Indarch (EH4) meteorite and a range of Mg-rich terrestrial rocks (magnesian basalt, basaltic komatiite, and peridotitic komatiite). All models were held at the iron-wüstite buffer to simulate the reducing conditions that likely existed during Mercury's formation. We then compared modeled mineral compositions and abundances, liquidus temperatures, and viscosities to better constrain the characteristics of the lavas that erupted on Mercury's surface. Our results show that the surface composition of Mercury is most similar to that of a terrestrial magnesian basalt (with lowered FeO), composed mainly of Mg-rich orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Because the model magmas are Mg-rich, their counterparts on Mercury would have erupted at high temperatures and displayed low viscosities. Producing melts of these compositions would have required high temperatures at the mantle source regions on Mercury. The inferred low-viscosity lavas would have erupted as thin, laterally extensive flows (depending upon their effusion rate) and would be expected to display surficial flow features that might be preserved to the present.},

abstract = {The discovery measurements of Mercury's exospheric magnesium, obtained by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) probe during its second Mercury flyby, are modeled to constrain the source and loss processes for this neutral species. Fits to a Chamberlain exosphere reveal that at least two source temperatures are required to reconcile the distribution of magnesium measured far from and near the planet: a hot ejection process at the equivalent temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees K, and a competing, cooler source at temperatures as low as 400K. For the energetic component, our models indicate that the column abundance that can be attributed to sputtering under constant southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions is at least a factor of five less than the rate dictated by the measurements. Although highly uncertain, this result suggests that another energetic process, such as the rapid dissociation of exospheric MgO, may be the main source of the distant neutral component. If meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts eject mainly molecules, the total amount of magnesium at altitudes exceeding ∼100km is found to be consistent with predictions by impact vaporization models for molecule lifetimes of no more than two minutes. Though a sharp increase in emission observed near the dawn terminator region can be reproduced if a single meteoroid enhanced the impact vapor at equatorial dawn, it is much more likely that observations in this region, which probe heights increasingly near the surface, indicate a reservoir of volatile Mg being acted upon by lower-energy source processes.}

Planets are created when grains aggregate, but how molecules form grains is an ongoing topic of discussion in astrophysics and planetary science. Using the spectroscopic data of molecules specifically involved in mineral formation could help to map regions where planet formation is believed to be occurring in order to examine the interplay between gas and dust. Four atoms are frequently associated with planetary formation: Fe, Si, Mg and O. Magnesium, in particular, has been shown to be in higher relative abundance in planet-hosting stars. Magnesium oxide crystals comprise the mineral periclase making it the chemically simplest magnesium-bearing mineral and a natural choice for analysis. The monomer, dimer and trimer forms of (MgO)n with n = 1–3 are analysed in this work using high-level quantum chemical computations known to produce accurate results. Strong vibrational transitions at 12.5, 15.0 and 16.5 μm are indicative of magnesium oxide monomer, dimer and trimer making these wavelengths of particular interest for the observation of protoplanetary discs and even potentially planet-forming regions around stars. If such transitions are observed in emission from the accretion discs or absorptions from stellar spectra, the beginning stages of mineral and, subsequently, rocky body formation could be indicated.}",

Magnesium has three stable isotopes, 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg, which can be produced in both massive and intermediate-mass (IM) stars with masses between 2 and 8 M⊙. In this work, we use constraints on the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and explore the role and mass range of IM stars using the observed isotopic ratios. We compare several models of stellar nucleosynthesis with metallicity-dependent yields and also consider the effect of rotation on the yields of massive stars and its consequences on the evolution of the Mg isotopes. We use a cosmic evolution model updated with new observational SFRD data and new reionization constraints coming from 2018 Planck Collaboration determinations. We find that the main contribution of 24Mg comes from massive stars whereas 25Mg and 26Mg come from IM stars. To fit the observational data on magnesium isotopic ratios, an additional IM SFRD component is preferred. Moreover, the agreement between model and data is further improved when the range of IM masses is narrowed towards higher masses (5–8 M⊙). While some rotation also improves the fit to data, we can exclude the case where all stars have high rotational velocities due to an overproduction of 26Mg.}",

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are “deterministic” by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness (“stochasticity”) is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements.}

abstract  ="Several significant improvements are proposed to the computational molecular spectroscopy protocol MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational–Vibrational Energy Levels) facilitating the inversion of a large set of measured rovibrational transitions to energy levels. The most important algorithmic changes include the use of groups of transitions{,} blocked by their estimated experimental (source segment) uncertainties{,} an inversion and weighted least-squares refinement procedure based on sequential addition of blocks of decreasing accuracy{,} the introduction of spectroscopic cycles into the refinement process{,} automated recalibration{,} synchronization of the combination difference relations to reduce residual uncertainties in the resulting dataset of empirical (MARVEL) energy levels{,} and improved classification of the lines and energy levels based on their accuracy and dependability. The resulting protocol{,} through handling a large number of measurements of similar accuracy{,} retains{,} or even improves upon{,} the best reported uncertainties of the spectroscopic transitions employed. To show its advantages{,} the extended MARVEL protocol is applied for the analysis of the complete set of highly accurate H216O transition measurements. As a result{,} almost 300 highly accurate energy levels of H216O are reported in the energy range of 0–6000 cm−1. Out of the 15 vibrational bands involved in accurately measured rovibrational transitions{,} the following three have definitely highly accurate empirical rovibrational energies of 8–10 digits of accuracy: (v1v2v3) = (0 0 0){,} (0 1 0){,} and (0 2 0){,} where v1{,} v2{,} and v3 stand for the symmetric stretch{,} bend{,} and antisymmetric stretch vibrational quantum numbers. The dataset of experimental rovibrational transitions and empirical rovibrational energy levels assembled during this study{,} both with improved uncertainties{,} is considerably larger and more accurate than the best previous datasets."}

The selection was based on a variety of considerations, with an important one being the quality of the atmosphere for the astronomy planned for the ELT. We present an overview of the characterization of the atmospheric parameters of candidate sites, making use of standard procedures and instruments as carried out within the Framework Programme VI (FP6) of the European Union. We have achieved full characterization of the selected sites for the parameters considered. Further details on adaptive optics results and climatology will be the subject of two forthcoming articles. A summary of the results of the FP6 site-testing campaigns at the different sites is provided.}
