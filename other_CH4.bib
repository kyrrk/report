abstract = {Methane's contribution to radiative forcing is second only to that of CO2. Though previously neglected, methane is now gaining increasing public attention as a GHG. At the recent COP26 in Glasgow, 105 countries signed “the methane pledge” committing to a 30% reduction in emissions from oil and gas by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Removal methods are complementary to such reduction, as they can deal with other sources of anthropogenic emissions as well as legacy emissions already accumulated in the troposphere. They can also provide future insurance in case biogenic emissions start rising significantly. This article reviews proposed methods for atmospheric methane removal at a climatically significant scale. These methods include enhancement of natural hydroxyl and chlorine sinks, photocatalysis in solar updraft towers, zeolite catalyst in direct air capture devices, and methanotrophic bacteria. Though these are still at an early stage of development, a comparison is provided with some carbon dioxide removal methods in terms of expected costs. The cheapest method is potentially enhancement of the chlorine natural sink, costing as little as $1.6 per ton CO2-eq, but this should be carried out over remote areas to avoid endangering human health. Complementarity with methane emissions reduction is also discussed.}

abstract = {Methane was measured in air samples collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of sites from 1983 to 1992. Sites range in latitude from 90°S to 82°N. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography, with flame ionization detection at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, and the measurements were referenced against a single calibration scale. The estimated precision of the measurements is ±0.2\%. Samples which had clear sampling or analytical errors, or which appeared to be contaminated by local CH4 sources, were identified and excluded from the data analysis. The data reveal a strong north-south gradient in methane with an annual mean difference of about 140 ppb between the northernmost and southernmost sampling sites. Methane time series from the high southern latitude sites have a relatively simple seasonal cycle with a minimum during late summer-early fall, almost certainly dominated by the seasonality in its photochemical destruction. Typical seasonal cycle amplitudes there are about 30 ppb. Seasonal cycles at sites in the northern hemisphere are complex when compared to sites in the southern hemisphere due to the interaction among CH4 sources and sinks, and atmospheric transport. Seasonal cycle amplitudes in the high north are about twice those observed in the high southern hemisphere. Annual mean methane mixing ratios were ∼1\% lower at 3397 m than at sea level on the island of Hawaii. Trends were determined at each site in the network and globally. The average increase in the globally averaged methane mixing ratio over the period of these measurements is (11.1±0.2) ppb yr−1. Globally, the growth rate for methane decreased from approximately 13.5 ppb yr−1 in 1983 to about 9.3 ppb yr−1 in 1991. The growth rate of methane in the northern hemisphere during 1992 was near zero. Various possibilities for the long-term, slow decrease in the methane growth rate over the last decade and the rapid change in growth rate in the northern hemisphere in 1992 are given. The most likely explanation is a change in a methane source influenced directly by human activities, such as fossil fuel production.},
