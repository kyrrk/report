title = {FURTHER DEFINING SPECTRAL TYPE “Y” AND EXPLORING THE LOW-MASS END OF THE FIELD BROWN DWARF MASS FUNCTION},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present the discovery of another seven Y dwarfs from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Using these objects, as well as the first six WISE Y dwarf discoveries from Cushing et al., we further explore the transition between spectral types T and Y. We find that the T/Y boundary roughly coincides with the spot where the J − H colors of brown dwarfs, as predicted by models, turn back to the red. Moreover, we use preliminary trigonometric parallax measurements to show that the T/Y boundary may also correspond to the point at which the absolute H (1.6 μm) and W2 (4.6 μm) magnitudes plummet. We use these discoveries and their preliminary distances to place them in the larger context of the solar neighborhood. We present a table that updates the entire stellar and substellar constituency within 8 pc of the Sun, and we show that the current census has hydrogen-burning stars outnumbering brown dwarfs by roughly a factor of six. This factor will decrease with time as more brown dwarfs are identified within this volume, but unless there is a vast reservoir of cold brown dwarfs invisible to WISE, the final space density of brown dwarfs is still expected to fall well below that of stars. We also use these new Y dwarf discoveries, along with newly discovered T dwarfs from WISE, to investigate the field substellar mass function. We find that the overall space density of late-T and early-Y dwarfs matches that from simulations describing the mass function as a power law with slope −0.5 &lt; α &lt; 0.0; however, a power law may provide a poor fit to the observed object counts as a function of spectral type because there are tantalizing hints that the number of brown dwarfs continues to rise from late-T to early-Y. More detailed monitoring and characterization of these Y dwarfs, along with dedicated searches aimed at identifying more examples, are certainly required.}

    abstract = {We report the discovery of three very late T dwarfs in the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Third Data Release: ULAS J101721.40+011817.9 (ULAS1017), ULAS J123828.51+095351.3 (ULAS1238) and ULAS J133553.45+113005.2 (ULAS1335). We detail optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry for all three sources, and mid-IR photometry for ULAS1335. We use NIR spectra of each source to assign spectral types T8p (ULAS1017), T8.5 (ULAS1238) and T9 (ULAS1335) to these objects. ULAS1017 is classed as a peculiar T8 (T8p) due to appearing as a T8 dwarf in the J band, whilst exhibiting H- and K-band flux ratios consistent with a T6 classification. Through comparison to BT-Settl model spectra we estimate that ULAS1017 has 750 K ≲Teff≲ 850 K, and 5.0 ≲ log g(cm s−2) ≲ 5.5, assuming solar metallicity. This estimate for gravity is degenerate with varying metallicity. We estimate that ULAS1017 has an age of 1.6–15 Gyr, a mass of 33–70MJ and lies at a distance of 31–54 pc. We do not estimate atmospheric parameters for ULAS1238 due to a lack of K-band photometry. We extend the unified scheme of Burgasser et al. to the type T9 and suggest the inclusion of the WJ index to replace the now saturated J-band indices. We propose ULAS1335 as the T9 spectral type standard. ULAS1335 is the same spectral type as ULAS J003402.77−005206.7 and CFBDS J005910.90−011401.3. We argue that given the similarity of the currently known \&gt;T8 dwarfs to the rest of the T dwarf sequence, the suggestion of the Y0 spectral class for these objects is premature. Comparison of model spectra with that of ULAS1335 suggest a temperature below 600 K, possibly combined with low gravity and/or high metallicity. We find ULAS1335 to be extremely red in NIR to mid-IR colours, with H−[4.49]= 4.34 ± 0.04. This is the reddest NIR to mid-IR colour yet observed for a T dwarf. The NIR to mid-IR spectral energy distribution of ULAS1335 further supports Teff \&lt; 600 K, and we estimate Teff∼ 550–600 K for ULAS1335. We estimate that ULAS1335 has an age of 0.6–5.3 Gyr, a mass of 15–31MJ and lies at a distance of 8–12 pc.},

title = {Chemical Equilibrium Abundances in Brown Dwarf and Extrasolar Giant Planet Atmospheres},
journal = {ApJ},
abstract = {We explore detailed chemical equilibrium abundance profiles for a variety of brown dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models, focusing in particular on Gl 229B, and derive the systematics of the changes in the dominant reservoirs of the major elements with altitude and temperature. We assume an Anders &amp; Grevesse solar composition of 27 chemical elements and track 330 gas-phase species, including the monatomic forms of the elements, as well as about 120 condensates. In our fiducial, limiting reference model, we do not assume that condensation sequesters elements at depth and present true chemical equilibrium calculations for the solar element mix. However, there is evidence in the atmosphere of Gliese 229B that it is depleted in heavy elements. To explore depletion and rainout, which are fundamentally nonequilibrium processes, we perform a series of rainout calculations in which refractory elements are withdrawn from the equilibrium in stoichiometric ratios via an ad hoc algorithm. Then we compare the true equilibrium results with the rainout results, with an eye to understanding the near-infrared spectrum of Gliese 229B, as well as the new "L dwarfs" with Teff's above ~1500 K. We address the issue of the formation and composition of clouds in the cool atmospheres of substellar objects. We conclude that the opacity of clouds of low-temperature (≤900 K), small-radius condensables (specific chlorides and sulfides, not silicates), may in part be responsible for the steep spectrum of Gl 229B observed in the near-IR below 1 μm. We assemble a temperature sequence of chemical transitions in substellar atmospheres that may be used to anchor and define a sequence of spectral types for substellar objects with Teff's from ~2200 to ~100 K.}

title = {The 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search. IV. Hunting Out T Dwarfs with Methane Imaging},
journal = AJ,
abstract = {We present first results from a major program of methane filter photometry for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The definition of a new methane filter photometric system is described. A recipe is provided for the differential calibration of methane imaging data using existing Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry. We show that these filters are effective in discriminating T dwarfs from other types of stars, and we demonstrate this with Anglo-Australian Telescope observations using the IRIS2 imager. Methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for 10 T dwarfs identified as part of the 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search, seven of them initially identified as T dwarfs using methane imaging. We also present near-infrared moderate-resolution spectra for five T dwarfs newly discovered by this technique. Spectral types obtained from these spectra are compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations and spectral types derived by other observers. Finally, we suggest a range of future programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowing of T dwarf and Y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation of near-infrared sky surveys, the robust detection of candidate planetary-mass brown dwarfs in clusters, the detection of T dwarf companions to known L and T dwarfs via deep methane imaging, and the search for rotationally modulated time-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.}

An instrument of reasonable mass (~1 lb) and power (few watts) is capable of measuring mixing ratios down to 0.1 part per 109 by volume, a hundred times lower than recently reported observations. Making accurate measurements of 13CH4 and CH3D will be more difficult. For measuring 313C to 10{\textperthousand} and $\delta$D to 50{\textperthousand}, sample preconcentration will be required to ~3 parts per 106 by volume for $\delta$13C and to ~40 parts per 106 by volume for $\delta$D. This need would be mitigated by the discovery of larger local abundances of methane near the source regions.},

abstract = {Methane's contribution to radiative forcing is second only to that of CO2. Though previously neglected, methane is now gaining increasing public attention as a GHG. At the recent COP26 in Glasgow, 105 countries signed “the methane pledge” committing to a 30% reduction in emissions from oil and gas by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Removal methods are complementary to such reduction, as they can deal with other sources of anthropogenic emissions as well as legacy emissions already accumulated in the troposphere. They can also provide future insurance in case biogenic emissions start rising significantly. This article reviews proposed methods for atmospheric methane removal at a climatically significant scale. These methods include enhancement of natural hydroxyl and chlorine sinks, photocatalysis in solar updraft towers, zeolite catalyst in direct air capture devices, and methanotrophic bacteria. Though these are still at an early stage of development, a comparison is provided with some carbon dioxide removal methods in terms of expected costs. The cheapest method is potentially enhancement of the chlorine natural sink, costing as little as $1.6 per ton CO2-eq, but this should be carried out over remote areas to avoid endangering human health. Complementarity with methane emissions reduction is also discussed.}

abstract = {Methane was measured in air samples collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of sites from 1983 to 1992. Sites range in latitude from 90°S to 82°N. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography, with flame ionization detection at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, and the measurements were referenced against a single calibration scale. The estimated precision of the measurements is ±0.2\%. Samples which had clear sampling or analytical errors, or which appeared to be contaminated by local CH4 sources, were identified and excluded from the data analysis. The data reveal a strong north-south gradient in methane with an annual mean difference of about 140 ppb between the northernmost and southernmost sampling sites. Methane time series from the high southern latitude sites have a relatively simple seasonal cycle with a minimum during late summer-early fall, almost certainly dominated by the seasonality in its photochemical destruction. Typical seasonal cycle amplitudes there are about 30 ppb. Seasonal cycles at sites in the northern hemisphere are complex when compared to sites in the southern hemisphere due to the interaction among CH4 sources and sinks, and atmospheric transport. Seasonal cycle amplitudes in the high north are about twice those observed in the high southern hemisphere. Annual mean methane mixing ratios were ∼1\% lower at 3397 m than at sea level on the island of Hawaii. Trends were determined at each site in the network and globally. The average increase in the globally averaged methane mixing ratio over the period of these measurements is (11.1±0.2) ppb yr−1. Globally, the growth rate for methane decreased from approximately 13.5 ppb yr−1 in 1983 to about 9.3 ppb yr−1 in 1991. The growth rate of methane in the northern hemisphere during 1992 was near zero. Various possibilities for the long-term, slow decrease in the methane growth rate over the last decade and the rapid change in growth rate in the northern hemisphere in 1992 are given. The most likely explanation is a change in a methane source influenced directly by human activities, such as fossil fuel production.},
