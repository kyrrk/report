title = {Chemical Equilibrium Abundances in Brown Dwarf and Extrasolar Giant Planet Atmospheres},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We explore detailed chemical equilibrium abundance profiles for a variety of brown dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models, focusing in particular on Gl 229B, and derive the systematics of the changes in the dominant reservoirs of the major elements with altitude and temperature. We assume an Anders &amp; Grevesse solar composition of 27 chemical elements and track 330 gas-phase species, including the monatomic forms of the elements, as well as about 120 condensates. In our fiducial, limiting reference model, we do not assume that condensation sequesters elements at depth and present true chemical equilibrium calculations for the solar element mix. However, there is evidence in the atmosphere of Gliese 229B that it is depleted in heavy elements. To explore depletion and rainout, which are fundamentally nonequilibrium processes, we perform a series of rainout calculations in which refractory elements are withdrawn from the equilibrium in stoichiometric ratios via an ad hoc algorithm. Then we compare the true equilibrium results with the rainout results, with an eye to understanding the near-infrared spectrum of Gliese 229B, as well as the new "L dwarfs" with Teff's above ~1500 K. We address the issue of the formation and composition of clouds in the cool atmospheres of substellar objects. We conclude that the opacity of clouds of low-temperature (≤900 K), small-radius condensables (specific chlorides and sulfides, not silicates), may in part be responsible for the steep spectrum of Gl 229B observed in the near-IR below 1 μm. We assemble a temperature sequence of chemical transitions in substellar atmospheres that may be used to anchor and define a sequence of spectral types for substellar objects with Teff's from ~2200 to ~100 K.}

title = {The 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search. IV. Hunting Out T Dwarfs with Methane Imaging*},
journal = AJ.,
abstract = {We present first results from a major program of methane filter photometry for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The definition of a new methane filter photometric system is described. A recipe is provided for the differential calibration of methane imaging data using existing Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry. We show that these filters are effective in discriminating T dwarfs from other types of stars, and we demonstrate this with Anglo-Australian Telescope observations using the IRIS2 imager. Methane imaging data and proper motions are presented for 10 T dwarfs identified as part of the 2MASS Wide-Field T Dwarf Search, seven of them initially identified as T dwarfs using methane imaging. We also present near-infrared moderate-resolution spectra for five T dwarfs newly discovered by this technique. Spectral types obtained from these spectra are compared to those derived from both our methane filter observations and spectral types derived by other observers. Finally, we suggest a range of future programs to which these filters are clearly well suited: the winnowing of T dwarf and Y dwarf candidate objects coming from the next generation of near-infrared sky surveys, the robust detection of candidate planetary-mass brown dwarfs in clusters, the detection of T dwarf companions to known L and T dwarfs via deep methane imaging, and the search for rotationally modulated time-variable surface features on cool brown dwarfs.}

abstract = {In light of the recent discovery of methane on Mars and its possible biological origin, a strategy is described for making in situ measurements of methane and its isotopes on the surface of Mars by laser spectroscopy in the 3.3-$\mu$m wavelength region. An instrument of reasonable mass (~1 lb) and power (few watts) is capable of measuring mixing ratios down to 0.1 part per 109 by volume, a hundred times lower than recently reported observations. Making accurate measurements of 13CH4 and CH3D will be more difficult. For measuring 313C to 10{\textperthousand} and $\delta$D to 50{\textperthousand}, sample preconcentration will be required to ~3 parts per 106 by volume for $\delta$13C and to ~40 parts per 106 by volume for $\delta$D. This need would be mitigated by the discovery of larger local abundances of methane near the source regions.},

abstract = {Methane's contribution to radiative forcing is second only to that of CO2. Though previously neglected, methane is now gaining increasing public attention as a GHG. At the recent COP26 in Glasgow, 105 countries signed “the methane pledge” committing to a 30% reduction in emissions from oil and gas by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. Removal methods are complementary to such reduction, as they can deal with other sources of anthropogenic emissions as well as legacy emissions already accumulated in the troposphere. They can also provide future insurance in case biogenic emissions start rising significantly. This article reviews proposed methods for atmospheric methane removal at a climatically significant scale. These methods include enhancement of natural hydroxyl and chlorine sinks, photocatalysis in solar updraft towers, zeolite catalyst in direct air capture devices, and methanotrophic bacteria. Though these are still at an early stage of development, a comparison is provided with some carbon dioxide removal methods in terms of expected costs. The cheapest method is potentially enhancement of the chlorine natural sink, costing as little as $1.6 per ton CO2-eq, but this should be carried out over remote areas to avoid endangering human health. Complementarity with methane emissions reduction is also discussed.}

abstract = {Methane was measured in air samples collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of sites from 1983 to 1992. Sites range in latitude from 90°S to 82°N. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography, with flame ionization detection at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, and the measurements were referenced against a single calibration scale. The estimated precision of the measurements is ±0.2\%. Samples which had clear sampling or analytical errors, or which appeared to be contaminated by local CH4 sources, were identified and excluded from the data analysis. The data reveal a strong north-south gradient in methane with an annual mean difference of about 140 ppb between the northernmost and southernmost sampling sites. Methane time series from the high southern latitude sites have a relatively simple seasonal cycle with a minimum during late summer-early fall, almost certainly dominated by the seasonality in its photochemical destruction. Typical seasonal cycle amplitudes there are about 30 ppb. Seasonal cycles at sites in the northern hemisphere are complex when compared to sites in the southern hemisphere due to the interaction among CH4 sources and sinks, and atmospheric transport. Seasonal cycle amplitudes in the high north are about twice those observed in the high southern hemisphere. Annual mean methane mixing ratios were ∼1\% lower at 3397 m than at sea level on the island of Hawaii. Trends were determined at each site in the network and globally. The average increase in the globally averaged methane mixing ratio over the period of these measurements is (11.1±0.2) ppb yr−1. Globally, the growth rate for methane decreased from approximately 13.5 ppb yr−1 in 1983 to about 9.3 ppb yr−1 in 1991. The growth rate of methane in the northern hemisphere during 1992 was near zero. Various possibilities for the long-term, slow decrease in the methane growth rate over the last decade and the rapid change in growth rate in the northern hemisphere in 1992 are given. The most likely explanation is a change in a methane source influenced directly by human activities, such as fossil fuel production.},
